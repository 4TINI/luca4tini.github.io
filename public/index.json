By randomly exposing units to a treatment we make sure that individuals in both groups are comparable, on average, and any difference we observe can be attributed to the treatment effect alone.\nHowever, often the treatment and control groups are not perfectly comparable. This could be due to the fact that randomization was not perfect or available. Not always we can randomize a treatment, for ethical or practical reasons. And even when we can, sometimes we do not have enough individuals or units so that differences between groups are seizable. This happens often, for example, when randomization is not done at the individual level, but at a higher level of aggregation, for example zipcodes, counties or even states.\nIn these settings, we can still recover a causal estimate of the treatment effect if we have enough information about individuals, by making the treatment and control group comparable, ex-post. In this blog post, we are going to introduce and compare different procedures to estimate causal effects in presence of imbalances between treatment and control groups that are fully observable. In particular we are going to analyze weighting, matching and regression procedures.\nExample Assume we had blog on statistics and causal inference ðŸ˜‡. To improve user experience, we are considering releasing a dark mode, and we would like to understand whether this new feature increases the time users spend on our blog.\nWe are not a sophisticated company, therefore we do not run an AB test but we simply release the dark mode and we observe whether users select it or not and the time they spend on the blog. We know that there might be selection: users that prefer the dark mode could have different reading preferences and this might complicate our causal analysis.\nWe can represent the data generating process with the following Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\nflowchart TB classDef included fill:#DCDCDC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef excluded fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef unobserved fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5; X1((gender)) X2((age)) X3((hours)) D((dark mode)) Y((read time)) D --\u0026gt; Y X1 --\u0026gt; Y X1 --\u0026gt; D X2 --\u0026gt; D X3 --\u0026gt; Y class D,Y included; class X1,X2,X3 excluded; We generate the simulated data using the data generating process dgp_darkmode() from src.dgp.

If we were runnig an AB test or randomized control trial, we could just compare users with and without the dark mode and we could attribute the difference in average reading time to the dark_mode.
