<p class="paragraph">Luca Fortini is a PostDoc at the <a href="https://hri.iit.it/">Human-Robot Interfaces and Interaction Laboratory</a>, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. He received his PhD degree in Bioengineering from the the Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB) at Politecnico di Milano in 2023. He is involved in multiple projects as the EU Horizon-2020 <a href="https://project-sophia.eu/"> SOPHIA</a> and in the ERC <a href="https://ergolean.eu/"> Ergo-Lean</a>. Moreover he leads the Real-Move project which was recently awarded with an ERC-POC grant.</p>

<p class="paragraph">His research is mainly focused on human modeling and motion capture for the development of feedback interfaces applicable to workers interacting with a robot during assistive or collaborative tasks in industrial scenarios.</p>
